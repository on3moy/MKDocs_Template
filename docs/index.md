## Customize Mkdocs Theme
If you want to quickly customize your theme, I suggest you start with built in themes!  
[Choosing Your Theme](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/choosing-your-theme/)


## Customize Mkdocs Theme with Material (Third Party Source)
If you like more capabilities for customization, try using **Material**.   
`pip install mkdocs-material`

!!! warning Note
    Before going through customization, ensure you know whether you want to use built in themes from MkDocs or Third Party.  
    - Built-in themes from Mkdocs is easier to work with and modify.  
    - Third-party themes such as Materials requires you use their documentation only for customization.
